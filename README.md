DataStructsCasesSimulator
=========================

This will let us compare different data structs performance. 
----------------------

Structures to use : 
  Simple linked lists and Double Linked Lists
      Operations :
        -Insert at the beginning
        -Insert at the end.
        -Insert in order.
        -Search for an element.
        -Delete at the beginning
        -Delete at the end
        -Delete a node
  Simple Linked Circular List and Double Linked Circular List
      Operations:
        -Insert
        -Insert in order
        -Search for an element
        -Clear
        -Delete a node
  Data Trees (Binary , AVL and Splay)
      Operations:
        -Insert
        -Search
        -Delete
  Stack (Arrays and Lists implementation)
      Operations :
        -Pop
        -Push
        -Top
  Queue (Arrays and Lists implementation)
      Operations:
        -Enqueue
        -Dequeue
  Priority Queue
      Operations :
        -Dequeue
        -Enqueue
  Double Queue(Arrays and Lists):
      Operations :
        -Insert at the beginning
        -Insert at the end
        -Delete beginning
        -Delete end
  Arrays (That is already implemented in Java) We will use this to compare
  with the data structures implemented with lists.
      Operations
        -Insert
        -Delete
        -Search
  We will build a new structure based on the previous.
      Operations
        -Insert
        -Delete
        -Search
  Sorting Algorithms implemented to work with lists and arrays.
